# Pytorch-Tutorial
Here is the tutorial series prepared during the course intelligent systems.
We will disscuss the following topics in order:
1. Pytorch Basics
2. Gradient and Backpropagation
3. Creating a Neural Net class using Inheritance of nn.Module
4. Dataset and Data Loader attributes and examples
5. How to implement CrossEntropyLoss(CEE) & BinaryCrossEntropyLoss(BCE) ?
6. Different ways to define Activation functions using torch, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional
7. A thorough example of implementing a Feedforward neural net using the MNIST dataset
8. Transfer Learning (Fine-tuning & Freezing), saving the model's best performance
